    <h4>Personal Values, Mission & Vision</h4>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Values</h5>
        <ul>
            <li class="definition"><strong>Wisdom</strong> - I value wisdom because it allows for good judgment and understanding. With good judgment, I can trust my decision-making ability. With understanding, I can know another one of my personal values, purpose.</li>
            <li class="definition"><strong>Trust</strong> - Trust is important to me in my relationships, as well as in myself. I hate acting in uncertain situations, so I try to understand as much as I can about things beforehand.</li>
            <li class="definition"><strong>Independence</strong> - I value the ability to act on my own, without having to depend on someone else for answers or permission.</li>
            <li class="definition"><strong>Justice</strong> - It is important to me that those who do good are rewarded equitably and those who do evil are punished impartially. For me, ffairness means equity in all things except opportunity - opportunity should be distributed equally, unfortunately the world does not work this way.</li>
            <li class="definition"><strong>Purpose</strong> - I believe that everything in the universe has a purpose, and all of us microcosms of the universe have roles to play in that purpose. While the universe's purpose is unknowable, our roles are not. It is important that everything I do aligns with what I believe to be my role. To <strong>trust</strong> that an action fits that criteria, I must have the <strong>wisdom</strong> to account for all foreseeable consequences of the action, and I must find that all of those consequences are <strong>just</strong> for the parties they affect.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Mission Statement</h5>
        <p class="block">I will strive to make a positive impact on the lives of every person I come into contact with, whether it be a barista I will never meet again, or a mentee I spend years developing. I will keep an open mind at all times, even when ideas conflict with my beliefs, and will not judge those who I do not understand. I will innovate always and will never stop learning – constantly seeking new perspectives and new understanding that foster diversity of thought and of ideas. I will promote such thinking in others, and will challenge those who choose close-mindedness and conformity. I will use energy, humor and vibrance to bring light to my ideals and to the truth. I will continue to serve those who need it, putting the needs of others before my own wants. I will be a leader.</p>
        <h5>Vision Statement</h5>
        <p class="block">A world where new ideas are cherished, equal opportunity is a reality, diversity is the norm, education is accessible for all, truth prevails, and justice trumps influence.</p>

    <h4>Personal SOAR Analysis</h4>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
        <ul>
            <li class="definition">Zeal - Exhibiting passion and commitment for the causes and ideals I value.</li>
            <li>Expression – Upon learning of a new concept, I can quickly assess it, place it into a frame of reference, and convey it accurately to others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Opportunities</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Build upon my experience in Jamaica by traveling and serving communities in need.</li>
            <li>Combine my writing abilities with my coding knowledge to build an online presence for activism.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Aspirations</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Raise awareness of issues related to injustice.</li>
            <li>Become an adept programmer and apply my knowledge as a social entrepreneur.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Results</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobilized masses incite change, and prove to other oppressed people that they are the masters of their nations and their governments.</li>
            <li>A social venture that provides a sustainable mechanism for change.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p class="block">Learning about the cruel injustices inflicted upon Jamaica and other underdeveloped nations has led me to become fiercely passionate for fairness, freedom, and the truth. I intend to fuel this passion by taking advantage of more study abroad opportunities provided by Iowa State, participating in local service initiatives, and advocating for dialogue on campus and online about what we as students can do to solve these issues. This will improve my understanding of the problems at the root of issues like Jamaica's debt, allowing me to better express and more effectively advocate for the need for change.</p>
        <p class="block">As an avid reader of online news and blogs, I know that the web provides an incredible platform to raise awareness and discuss problems that big news outlets might overlook. I want to leverage my journalism experience and web development skills to begin building an online presence where I can share my ideas, facilitate conversation, and make a name for myself as an activist. This will also help me showcase my work to cause-driven technology companies whose values align with my own, where I could further hone my programming skills and spread my ideas to a larger audience.</p>

    <h4>Leadership Goals</h4>
    <div class="section">
        <h5>At Iowa State</h5>
        <p><strong>Develop next year's Executive Director(s) of St. Jude Up 'til Dawn</strong> - My involvement with St. Jude Up 'til Dawn has had an enormous impact on my college experience and my career aspirations. However, it is a young and fragile organization, and I often worry that the future leaders will not be able to keep SJUtD growing at Iowa State, or worse, that  SJUtD might dwindle and disappear entirely. To keep SJUtD thriving, we need a transformational leader, and I intend to be that leader this fall. My goal for the remainder of my time as Executive Director is to cultivate the leaders of the next Executive Board by teaching them lessons I've learned, giving them confidence in their abilities, and instilling in them a fervent passion for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</p><br/>
        <p><strong>Bring the fun back to TKE</strong> - My first semester at Iowa State, TKE was so much fun to be a part of – even Yell Like Hell. Even though the transactional tactic of "do this because you have to" was used, it didn't feel like a chore because it was fun to be a member of TKE and everyone was invested in our goals. But since then, the chapter has lost its way, brotherhood was usurped by lectures of "you guys need to do stuff for this house" and fun was replaced with negativity. Before graduating, I want to bring the fun back to TKE and reengage everyone in the chapter's success. To do this, I want to show our younger members what it truly means to be a TKE, foster a love for Epsilon, and get them bought in to a purpose that is so much larger than themselves.</p><br/>
        <p><strong>Spirit Coordinator for Greek Week</strong> - I will be a Spirit Coordinator for Greek Week Central my last semester at Iowa State. I want to do this to get out of my comfort zone, and to improve my public speaking ability and stage presence. I will obtain this position by working hard at my position on GWC next year and taking advantage of opportunities to prove my ability to speak in front of a large audience.</p><br/>

        <h5>After Graduation</h5>
        <p><strong>Start a business</strong> - I will become an entrepreneur after graduating from Iowa State. Immediately following graduation, I will obtain a position as a developer at an Internet company with a socially-concerned mission. After gaining experience there, I will leave to start my own company whose business model is founded on the principles of freedom of information and transparency.</p><br/>
        <p><strong>Serve as advisor for a TKE chapter</strong> - Wherever I end up living after graduation, I will find and reach out to the nearest TKE chapter and offer them my service as a chapter advisor. I have learned so much about leadership, what it means to be Greek and what it means to be a Teke during my time at Iowa State, and I wish to share this knowledge with others who could use it to benefit their chapter and community. I think I could be an effective advisor to any chapter in the fraternity.</p>

    <h4>Leadership Summary</h4>
    <div class="section">
        <!--<h5 class="no">a</h5>-->
        <ul>
            <li class="definition">Leadership: a process in which a person influences people towards a common goal.</li>
            <!--<h5 class="no">b</h5>-->
            <li class="definition">Service: an action taken with the intent to benefit another; an experience where one puts the needs of another before their own, with no tangible reward and often at their own expense; an experience of mystery where one submits to the control of a larger, greater purpose.</li>

            <li class="definition">Philanthropy: the process that diverts resources to alleviate social needs that business cannot solve; "the market for love"; "the market for those who have no other market coming." (Dan Pallotta)</li>

            <li class="definition">Civic engagement: the amount of involvement that citizens have in deciding how the resources of their community will be allocated; the right of the people to define the public good, determine the policies by which they will seek the good, and reform/replace institutions that do not serve that good.</li>
            <!--<h5 class="no">c</h5>-->
            <li class="definition">Life-long Greek Community membership: Although it may not feel like it when I walk out of my last chapter as an undergraduate, I will always wear my letters, and intend to stay active and engaged in TKE Epsilon as an alumni. Whether it's by coming back for Homecoming, donating to Lawn Display, becoming a stakeholder in 224 Ash, LLC, or helping an undergraduate find an internship, I will do my best to support the active members of TKE Epsilon. While the responsibilities a life-loyal Teke are fairly straight-forward, being a life-long Greek Community member isn't as defined. To me it means that I will live my values, but I also think it means sticking to my belief that going Greek is a positive experience, even in the face of headlines that might say otherwise. Life-long membership is defending Greek affiliation when someone speaks badly about any organization, whether it's my own or one I've never heard of.</li>
            <!--<h5 class="no">d</h5>-->
            <li class="definition">Example of Greek Relevance: The best example of an experience I've had in TKE that relates to our discussions in class is the leadership styles of our past two presidents. Caleb is a charismatic leader – the kind of leader who says one thing during discussion and changes the outcome of a vote. Jon on the other hand, was an altruistic leader. He might not command the room whenever he speaks, but he out-worked everyone else and gave everything he had to TKE. They both had different leadership styles but they both were highly esteemed because every member knew that they had the best interests of the chapter at heart.</li>
        </ul>
